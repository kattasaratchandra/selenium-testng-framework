please refer to the following notes for the code implementation:

- Introduced a `BaseTest` abstract class to centralize WebDriver setup and teardown using
TestNG annotations.
- Implemented a `Driver` utility class to manage WebDriver initialization and cleanup,
ensuring browser sessions are handled per test.
- Added a `DriverManager` class using `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>` for thread-safe driver
management, supporting parallel test execution.
- Used `final` for test classes and utility classes (`Driver`, `DriverManager`) to
prevent inheritance and enforce immutability.
- Defined private constructors in utility classes to prevent instantiation.
- Created simple, final test classes (`GoogleHomePageTest`, `GoogleLoginPageTest`)
that extend `BaseTest` and contain only test logic.
- Configured `testng.xml` for parallel method execution to leverage thread-local
WebDriver instances.

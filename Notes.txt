created simple tests to build framework from scratch. Focused mainly on building framework
around the tests.

Base Test and Driver classes:
1. Driver handles WebDriver lifecycle, BaseTest manages setup/teardown, and test classes contain only test logic.
2. Base Test constructor defined as protected which  prevents direct instantiation.
3. Test classes defined as final, preventing inheritance.
